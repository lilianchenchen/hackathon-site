To Reduce Safety Concerns and speed of production for POC

We have opted to select a pre-existing device PZEM-016

Voltage (80-260VAC)
Current (0-100A)
Active Power (0-23000W)
Accumulated Power (0-9999kWh)
Frequency (45-65Hz)
Power Factor (0.00 â€“ 1.00)

This meter has RS485 and Modbus RTU slave protocol, which facilitates communication since Modbus RTU in RS485 is an industrial standard,
